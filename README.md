Set in 1850 CE in the village of Veppur, "Thangalaan" introduces us to Thangalaan Muni, a respected village chief whose life takes a drastic turn when his land is seized by the zamindar, forcing him and his family into bonded labor. The arrival of Lord Clement, a British officer seeking gold, sets in motion a chain of events that will forever alter the fate of Thangalaan and his community.

Clement, aware of the villagers' ancestral knowledge of gold extraction, enlists Thangalaan's help to locate the precious metal. Their journey into the heart of a forbidden forest, guarded by the mythical sorceress Aarathi, unveils a history of exploitation, betrayal, and the struggle for survival.

As Thangalaan delves deeper into the quest for gold, he is haunted by visions of Aarathi, warning him of the dangers that lie ahead. His son, Asokan, becomes possessed by Aarathi's spirit, urging him to abandon the quest and return to their village.
